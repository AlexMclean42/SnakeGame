# SnakeGame
The Arduino Snake Game on a 16x2 LCD with Joystick Control is a fun and interactive project that brings the classic Snake game to life using an Arduino board, a 16x2 LCD screen, and a joystick. This project is a great way to learn about interfacing components with Arduino and implementing simple gaming logic.

Key Components:
Elegoo/Arduino board (e.g., Elegoo Uno R3)
16x2 LCD screen
Joystick module
Pushbutton (for joystick button)
Jumper wires
Breadboard
